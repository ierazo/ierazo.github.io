I am Ignacio Erazo, a fourth year Ph.D. candidate at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My research interests include the development of efficient optimization algorithms and heuristics for intelligent decision-making, but also large-scale simulation-optimization procedures. Ever since joining GT I have been working under the supervision of [Prof. Alejandro Toriello](https://sites.gatech.edu/alejandro-toriello/) and [Prof. David Goldsman](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/david-goldsman); and I am currently looking for opportunities in industry.
