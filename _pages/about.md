I am a Research Scientist II working at Amazon Fulfillment Technologies (AFT); my main focus is on creating and deploying new algorithms for large-scale online order planning, picking and execution on state-of-the-art robotic-assisted warehouses. 

Before joining Amazon, I got my Ph.D. on Operations Research with a minor in Machine Learning at Georgia Tech, where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Alejandro Toriello](https://sites.gatech.edu/alejandro-toriello/) and [Prof. David Goldsman](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/david-goldsman).

My research interests include the development of efficient optimization algorithms and heuristics for large-scale intelligent decision-making. I am also broadly interested in combinatorial optimization, and hybrid solution methods such as simulation-optimization and optimization enhanced with learning. For an (almost) updated list of research projects please visit the [Publications](https://ierazo.github.io/publications/) tab.
