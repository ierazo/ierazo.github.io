I am Ignacio Erazo, a Research Scientist II working at Amazon Fulfillment Technologies (AFT), focused on creating and deploying new algorithms for robotic-assisted order picking in state-of-the-art warehouses. My research interests include the development of efficient optimization algorithms and heuristics for intelligent decision-making, but also large-scale simulation-optimization procedures and combinatorial optimization. I got my Ph.D. on Operations Research at Georgia Tech, and worked under the supervision of [Prof. Alejandro Toriello](https://sites.gatech.edu/alejandro-toriello/) and [Prof. David Goldsman](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/david-goldsman). For an (almost) updated list of research projects please visit the [Publications](https://ierazo.github.io/publications/) tab.
